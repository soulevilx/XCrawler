    "description": { "_content": "For a long time, my photography was called &quot;MLR Photo&quot; or &quot;MLR Photo Art&quot;.  Several  years ago, since most of my non nude work is portraits, and &quot;stories&quot;  in images; for business purposes, I &quot;rebranded&quot; it as &quot;Portraits and Stories&quot;.  Except that, until recently, I didn't make the change on Flickr, because Flickr hadn't allowed &quot;business use&quot; of the account. \n And, I hadn't changed it on Facebook, because they wouldn't allow the change. \n\nThey might, finally, now.  \n\nThis post is part of the process.\n\n\nExperienced, semi pro, photographer.   Most of my interest is portrait and artistic nudity.  I do some fashion oriented work for amusement, and some glamour type things to please the models on occasion.\n\nIf any ladies would like to model, please let me know.  No money, but we each get some nice pictures.  I'll do anything from kid safe to fully nude, but no interest in porn.  In the vast majority of cases, a shoot will include nudes, and fully clothed. I am WAY over 18, for those who care.\n\nI'm starting to have a decent collection here, and i love feedback.  I welcome comments, But I insist on respect for the models.  I don't accept all group invites for my photos, although I appreciate the offer.  In general, something like 'Artistic nudes&quot; is going to be a yes, while &quot;big tits&quot; is not.  Also, I don't knowingly join &quot;Post one, comment fifty&quot; type groups.  And, I comment on what interests me, not as a fee for adding my photos.  If you invite my pictures to your group, I consider it acceptance of this policy.  Finally, with regard to groups; if I can't see the images in the group, or if they appear to be tacky, exploitative, or otherwise something I don't want to be associated with, I will not accept.\n\nCrude comments will earn a block.  I will not give out contact information for models.  But if you are a photographer interested in working with one of the models, you may contact me, and if possible, I'll pass your information along.  Naturally, having a legitimate photostream is essential.\n\nI add people who interest me, either as inspirational photographers, as potential models, or occasionally because we've had a few nice chats.  It is largely a symbolic gesture, I have no &quot;friends only&quot; pictures.  I do NOT add people based on demands.  \n\nIf you are an adult, and post adult content (as in &quot;content intended for adults&quot; not necessarily &quot;porn.&quot;), and actually, even if you don't post adult content, joining the following group is a good idea. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/groups\/unsafe\">Adult Flickr Members: How NOT to get Deleted!<\/a>" },
